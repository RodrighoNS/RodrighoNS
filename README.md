- 👋 Hi, I’m @RodrighoNS! greetings from South America!
- 🧑‍💻 I'm a Software Developer currently working with Ruby on Rails.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript for my day-to-day work, Docker, CI/CD and AWS workflows to improve my web devs skills and Deep Learning topics (theory and a bit of practice with Python) looking for new problems to solve, specially focused in audio signals. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects to learn new skills: Backend (Go, Rust), Frontend (React and general JS), Multiplatform (Flutter specially), and any other interesting thing I can found.
- 🖥️ In the recent past I had jobs related with system administration (local servers and telephone exchange), software administration for SaaS companies (Google workspace, Slack, Github), hardware support (Mac and Windows machines) and general IT support. 
- 🚧 I have some practical experience with Java, C#, Data Mining (Hadoop ecosystem and PySpark) and Cibersecurity too, but I'm not too interested in these topics.
